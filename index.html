        <div class="prayer-text">
            <p>Heavenly Father,</p>
            
            <p>Right now, at this very moment at Columbia University Hospital, Your child Buddy is in surgery receiving new lungs and a new chance at life. We come before You with hearts full of hope and trust.</p>
            
            <p>Lord, guide the hands of the surgeons with precision and wisdom. Let their every movement be steady, their every decision clear. We ask that You watch over each step of this delicate transplant procedure.</p>
            
            <p>Protect Buddy's body as it receives these new lungs. Let there be no complications, no rejection, no unexpected difficulties. Instead, we pray for a perfect fit, for vessels that connect seamlessly, for tissues that bond completely.</p>
            
            <p>Fill these new lungs with Your breath of life. What a beautiful thing it is, that in the very city where his lungs were once damaged, You are bringing about this remarkable restoration. What was meant for harm, You are using for healing.</p>
            
            <p>Give Buddy strength through these long hours of surgery. Though he is unconscious, his warrior spirit remains. The same determination that made him the "Captain Kirk" of his world is working even now, fighting alongside the medical team for his recovery.</p>
            
            <p>Comfort Carol, Bryan, Kelly, and all who love him as they wait. Replace anxiety with peace, fear with faith, and worry with a profound sense of Your presence.</p>
            
            <p>We believe Buddy will come through this surgery successfully. We believe these new lungs will fill with air and work perfectly. We believe there are still chapters to be written in his story – more moments with those he loves, more laughter to share, more life to live.</p>
            
            <p>And Lord, in the coming hours when he wakes, ease his pain, calm his fears, and let his first breaths with these new lungs be strong and clear – the beginning of a beautiful new season.</p>
            
            <div class="prayer-ending">
                In the powerful name of Jesus, the Great Physician and Giver of Life, we pray.
                <p>Amen.</p>
